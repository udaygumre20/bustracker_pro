🚌 BusTracker Pro

BusTracker Pro is a modern Progressive Web Application (PWA) designed to provide real-time intercity bus tracking for passengers while enabling drivers to share live location, occupancy status, and emergency alerts. The system focuses on improving transparency, safety, and reliability in public and private bus transportation systems.

This project was developed as an academic and practical solution to common problems faced by passengers such as uncertain arrival times, lack of real-time updates, and inefficient communication between drivers and passengers.
